	 don't have time to tune that monster of a WAF rule...


	 changing the debian IP addrs to wikileaks.org 


	 implementing forward IP blocking logic was more complex than anticipated. 
	 in the case of client -> edge ghost -> origin, it works as expected. 
	
	 however, when ghost executes waf logic at the edge, it will send signed header assertions to the parent
	 if the parent sees one of these HAs, it will not execute WAF logic again 
	
	 how nice for those poor parental flits. But I've got an internet to protect against here. 
	 I need the cacheH tier to likewise execute forward IP WAF blocks
	
	 this magestic piece of xml is artisanlly crafted, locally compiled, and slowly linked to achieve this noble goal. 
	
	 I should have logged into a server in Brooklyn and authored it in ed to truly do it justice. 


	 if a UCDS edge ghost gets a Policy Engine request for WAF it needs to
	   (a) perform the WAF processing on the edge
	   (b) also signal to the cacheH parent (if cacheH is used) that the parent should also process WAF rules for forward IP blocks.


	 this configuration is working for both client and foward IP blocking
	 as long as cacheH is turned off for the hoit in arl.data
	 gonna fix that next. 


	 laying groundwork for client and forward IP blocking.

	 honor-cc and honor-expires are not behaving in an intuitive way. 
	 working out the best way to support Cache-Control/Expires headers from origin in an OTT world...


	 pre-fetching is the bomb for perf on the SaaS apps. Trinity, not so much. 


	 sooooo.... for some reason pconns are turned off in baseline-essl.xml
	 don't know if Meredith is testing something or what. 
	 at any rate, I'm perf testing UCDS and this is killing me, so I wrapped those pconn statements in a region attribute match 
	 now UCDS will pick up the default to use pconns.

	 hardcoding EVERY request for ott content to use trinity. 
	 there is a broad problem here in that in a real production situation, the SWG_TRINITY variable will be set 
	 based on the content policy assertion. As designed, CPA lookup is only done on the edge. 
	 will fix that on the next check in 


	 using edge and parent infrastructure in Reston lab. 


	 updated cacheH map for reston lab
	 pulled trinity pearl inclusion from request.type match (so it gets applied at the parent too)

	fixing problem where ghost will complain at shutdown that it can't evaluate the akamai:template calls 
	 for waf; they are only evaluated at startup. 
	
	 due to ghost metadata loading, this problem was caused because I made an akamai:insert call for the

	   initial checkin.


	   brain dump. 


	   giving away my essl toplevel in devb to Blake/Bonci for p4d dev. sniff. 


	   ah yeah. re-direct chasing. need to squash that at the ghost and not forward the 302 to the client. 


	   and bumping the freaking contentversion. 


	   syncing up green cookie value with shit that is in baseline.xml 


	   re-pointing the origin to gcds netstorage cluster. 


	   gcds netstorage cookie magick. 


	   turning off deny requests for the moment. 


	   initial checkin


	   bump contentversion 


	   putting us into the new (static) gtm domains. 


	   setting up test domain. Forcing all upload and download into region 75 for the moment. 


	   setting up "customer" facing upload/download domains. 


	   upload domains. 


	   download domains for each region -- only using 1 ghost. 


	   forgot that I need storage AND storageN ...


	   fetchd NOT fetch


	   one property for each fetch domain in regions 75 and 76 


	   and the sibling domains for storage1 ...


	   storage1 zone. ftpXXXXX names go here .


	   stub zone. ultimately might not use gtm subdomain, but working on setting up fetchd hostnames. 


	   works well enough now. checking in. 


	   these files work well enough now for a first check in. 


	   wrong backend IPs in region 76 


	   updating install groups. 


	   reverting to previous host tags. settting up switchip so snmp2q can talk to the netapp. 


	   forgot to add region 76 NFS settings. 


	   more NFS tweaking. 


	   adding storage agg.

	   fixed an error where ~95 vulns were incorrectly listed as NA ... 
	   updated some of the "reasons" field for why these vulns are known, good, exceptions despite what the SRR reports. 


	   added reasons for a number of new findings that are Not Applicable. In current SRR version, these show up as NEW findings. 


	   looking at newly fetched tarball from scan.py -- not the tarball archived in scans/...


	   initial check in. 


	   This script will take a "stock" SRR results xml file and compare it against a known 
	   database of vulnerability IDs that we mark differently in VMS. For each vulnerability 
	   found, the XML is updated to reflect our correct/final VMS posture. 


	   adding results of backend netstorage role_type. 


	   correct path to PDI database. Fragile though with "Script.August" in the path ...


	   added netstorage_backend asset. 


	   changed to relative python path in project 


	   using relative path to python2.6 built with the project instead of /usr/bin/env. 


	   another round of gcds changes. rebasing off of acs-2971. 


	   adding staticinfo tablesa for netmgmt. 


	   I feel like I have solved this problem before .... lgu == old man. 


	   specify the crossnetwork, yo.


	   added netmgmt to the mega agg config. 


	   initial check in. 


	   too bleeding edge on 3158. reverting back to 2971. 


	   bleeding edge of acs-3158.

	stripped down to essentials, I think. 


	   sandbox hacking. 


	   fixing bad authgate hostname. 


	   remove KMI_CLIENT_NETWORKS tag from AUDITSERVER. 


	   The $kmi_email value had not been set yet in usereg(). changing to use 
	   configuration_global('mcdn_domain_name')	
	   Code review: not needed since this is a minor change


	   added authgate.sqa.mdcn.akamai.com to configfile so our auditservers try to gwsh to that instead of 
	   corporate akamai ones. 


	   multiple kdc_hosts please. 


	   used wrong alsi api call. changed from create_user to create_alias
	   Code review: not needed since this is a minor change


	   checkin. just updated install and configvers for all sshable/loginable servers. 


	   library to create ephemeral p4 client so we can modify the sqlite db and
	   persist back to p4 after any changes. 


	   two more helper scripts. 


	   helper script used to bootstrap the database with info from lab servers.


	   updated pingable/sshable hosts. 


	   first cut at database that contains status of all GCDS lab servers. 


	   reclaiming 172.26.109.146 from the ignoble life of AUDIT_COLLECTOR. 


	   removing dedicated audit_collector. we're going to use shared group of machines across all labs if you need acdf-* generation. 


	   restoring the missing purgeapi server. 


	   removing 108.146. This is our SQA emailgw. 


	   removed 108.146 server. This is our SQA emailgw. 


	   removing 112.14 from config. lgu doing lab cleanup. 


	   fixed bug with target for sqlite


	   checkin. 


	   added note that this release requires updates to CCI dns zones. 


	   The 112.25 and 108.153 boxen are not installed as emailgw servers just yet. 
	   This is causing a backup of mail on the corporate email gateways. 
	
	   Reverting MX record to  point back to the 108.146 box. 


	   added check for cpcoder script. 


	   adding new portsets to CCI hostnames. 


	   fixing ccid2 rolls round in the lab. We need to add the dns records for 
	   the new portsets > 61442


	   added rest of kdc_hosts to tag. Changed leadership of KDC for testing GCDSINF-2805 install instructions. 


	   removed references to KMI_CLIENT_NETWORKS. Our auditservers don't use this tag because we want them to be able to audit all networkss (and we have light enough load that we do not need the loadbalancing inherent in this tag...


	   replaced /bin/sh with /bin/bash due to use of temp named pipes in at least one of the scripts. Even though /bin/sh is linked to /bin/bash, if you invoke bash as /bin/sh it will mimic /bin/sh functionality. 
	
	   Annoying but true. 


	   argh. adding additional KDC servers so keyagent can get configured correctly. 


	   aligning with the s_forward cert that is deployed in SQA KDC. 


	   aligning with debian-jade changes introduced in mcdn-dpi-1.5


	   the debian-jade stanza just appears to be plain wrong in dpi-4.0.4. 
	   I'm reverting to the .debs specified for debian-jade-1.0 in our previous DPI comp. 


	   damn. forgot to check this in. I am adding debian-jade back in to 
	   satisfy dependencies on BUILDLAYER machines. 


	   adding the great and mighty Dan to our user set. 


	   fixed command line (extra space for step_12.sh)
	   also learned about redirection + subshell in that script to create a tmp named pipe. 
	   namaste, Ed Faulkner, namaste. 


	   updated CCI channels to use new portsets. 


	   fixed expired cert for test.sqa.mcdn.akamai.com 
	   added cert for control.sqa.mcdn.akamai.com


	   added region 18 for Rick W's gviews. 


	   Updated document to remove extraneous instructions that were relevant to the original GCDSESS-3022 release, but are not relevant to this point release. 


	   added instructions for Hersey's checkconfig.pl tool to validate the configuration.essl file. 
	
	   added instructions to copy configfile_xmlizer over to packed release dir. 


	   initial check in. 


	   updating to catch up the .1 instructions. 


	   ugh. inserted manual copy of file for mapper barebones config files. 


	   initial check in. NOT READY FOR USE. 


	   pointing prod mail to 172.26.112.24 as tmp fix to make corp IT happy. 


	   updated to include new/improved Manual Change CR. 


	   The previous script I wrote for the manual CR works fine except that if akamai_run 
	   restarts the ipchains service, the changes to the firewall are erased. 
	
	   This script is the updated version. It updates the /a/sbin/start_ipchains script directly. 
	   Must be installed post-incremental as hostsetup will erases the changes. 


	   ccomr catchup. 


	   parse logfile from cron job running on Chris's new querylib enabled boxen. 


	   output csv. 


	   initial checkin. 


	   updated LDS boxen to current LDS service running on SQA portal. 


	   meant to clean this up earlier. forgot. tackling now. 


	   added error checks to the REJECT rulesets per Casto's review. 


	   updated proper usage of the manual change CR script. 


	   initial check in. QA'd in mapper SQA lab. 


	   bump. 


	   bump 1.4 -> 1.4.2


	   removing email_relay settings for ESSL regions. 


	   reviewed again for accuracy. updated overview. added Manual Change section for NSD.
	   need to write the iptables script for the manual change now and then update this doc
	   one last time. 


	   fixed $Id$ tag -- helpful in troubleshooting ;)


	   fixing up bootstrap section. 


	   updated to add more role types for archival. 


	    testing email variable for kmi-admin email. 


	   added support for creating user aliases per documentation:
	   https://docs.akamai.com/nms/syseng/installsuite/os-install-and-configuration/alsi-config.html#2.3
	   section 2.3
	
	   using is_kdc() to determine if we are running on a KDC and then setting kmi-admin in /etc/alises. 
	   pointing to value of global variable 'kmi_admin_email' in configuration.infra


	   added support for kmi_admin_email tag. 


	   bump. 


	   bump. 


	   added email_swans variable. 


	   first cut at a QA position for gcds. 


	   emai_ghost and email_swans explicitly set. 


	   added global_root_hints variable. 


	   helper script to base64 encode hints files. 


	   log address cleanup:
	       logaddress == logs@sqa.mcdn.akamai.com
	       email_all == logs@sqa.mcdn.akamai.com
	       [ removed specific email_$SERVICE configs ]
	
	       all email_relay setttings for regions changed from lab QA relays to mail.sqa.mcdn.akamai.com


	   checkpoint before the weekend. The release is starting to tighten up now. 


	   another checkpoint. these are still a work in progress. 


	   checkpoint. Just saving work. 


	   LDS wired up now. It currently uses our dev box. as GCDSPORT-2718 goes to 
	   SQA, we'll repoint these to the correct SQA IP address. 


	   wiring up LDS for sqa


	   tlargy wrote these. I'm putting them here until we get something cleaned up in agora. 


	   Added correct email variables per Andy's notes in CR 419471
	       - email_ghost = logger@ddc....
	
	   Added NIPR and SIPR specific installs for logger variables. 


	   reviewing install notes prior to going into SQA. 
	
	   * added sections for configfile-xml-pusher.pl (PRE and POST)
	
	     In current releases, the MapperBareBones file is generated at CDP time, however, 
	     it is not in a format that our mapping system can currently consume. 
	
	     Therefore, we have to continue to a manual push of the BareBones files. 
	
	   * Fixed install groups -- these instructions were previously inherited from 
	     a doc that I wrote for the ghost 5.6.4 upgrade where we added an install phase 
	     for SATX on NIPR. Reverting back to our normal 5 install phases. 
	
	   * Small typo in netdeploy command. We're only doing incrementals, but the command 
	     specifies a kernel + incremental (this too was a mistake inherited from my 
	     previous install instructions :)


	   initial branch of gcds ACS project. Using latest world-deployed version of ACS.


	   staff meeting minutes for gcds-eng in Cambridge.

	   gcds-leads weekly minutes 08/31/09


	   updated with --post-script option for script to restart named. 


	   postscript restart for named. 


	   minutes from team lead meeting. 


	   adding ktext to pick up Id string. 


	   after running through the rotation instuctions I learned more about how the init-db 
	   verb of the kmi_admin utility works and I figured out that I didn't need to re-init
	   the entire damn database. I could just update the GPG files in the kdc_bootstrap 
	   table. 
	
	   Also taking into account feedback on instructions from Ops. This doc is now more 
	   complete. 


	   improved rotation script. After reviewing the internals of the init-db verb of the 
	   kmi_admin script it became clear that my previous solution of "re-initializing" the 
	   kdc bootstrap table was overweight. Instead of that whole process (which for example
	   generates new kdc <-> auditserver identities, I only needed to update the kdc_bootstrap
	   table with the ascii armored kdc gpg keys. 
	
	   This script does just that - it reads the gpg keys from disk and then uses DBI to issue 
	   the sql UPDATE command. 


	   bump to accomodate mcdn-debpackageinfo-1.4.1


	   bumping to include debian-bind9 5.0.4


	   2nd stab at correct integrate of cgleba's changes. 


	   second stab at proper integrate of cgleba's changes. 


	   integrate from cgleba's sandbox per request from Chris. 


	   duh. this seemed like a good idea years ago. now it seems silly. 
	   bumping attr version to 1.4.1 to produce proper componentinfo.xml 


	   bump 1.4.1


	   bump to 1.3.1


	   branch 1.4 -> 1.4.1


	   branch 1.3 -> 1.3.1


	   updated to include Andy's improved method of generating keys. 


	   put in a warning that we need to modify the script before using it in mcdn-2312. 


	   we're going to repurpose his script to init the kdc database with new KDC GPG keys. 


	   checkin

	   whitespace fixes


	   moved into provisioning/workflow.txt


	   housekeeping - moving stuff around...


	   first, rough cut at basic provisioning of edge/relay icecast config. 


	   before I forget...


	   these are my files I use to test the /rock and /jazz icecast streams. 


	   put in new admin passphrase. 
	
	   Since these boxes are going to be on a public IP soon, I didn't want the 
	   default admin password out there...


	   fixed admin web path


	   bumped up max clients and encoder connections. 
	   tuning notes on burst-on-connect and listener buffers
	   password changes for encoders, relays, and admin
	   changing to user/group of akamai/akamai -- user nobody doesn't exist on alsi boxen
	     (should get aana uid/gid, but not if this is throwaway ...)


	   bumping up index number of test.dev.mcdn.akamai.com to test x509 w/ SAN


	   can specify a ssl key/cert pair instead of auto-generated ones. 


	   spits out a new a248 SSL cert and creates a new a248e.xml file for ghost. 


	   using programatically generated one. 
	   gen_a248_xml.pl in gcdsghosttest-1.0

	   This tool is not reliable at loads > 1 Gbps per Tim Dunn so it doesn't have a 
	   future on the commercial side. My patch to it sets the destination port to only 
	   use one port to support our ACL-heavy environment on GCDS. 


	   enabling ghost reporting of footprint by cpcode into cp_objects query table. 
	   w00t!


	   pulling this back to the lab sites instead of what is in production. 


	   do not increment destination port number


	   branch into sandbox. 


	   refactoring. All 18 tests now pass in the lab and correctly take into account our 
	   non-exisitant-really region 2 configuration for ESSL that we had to hack up to 
	   get mapper working properly. 


	   removed release-specific naming from the doc. 
	
	   generic naming of GCDS ESSL Checklist...


	   branch to take 2770's checklist for ESSL. 


	   added descriptions of metadata files that need to be pushed. 
	
	   This was done on the NIPRNET prior to the packing on the mcdn-2268 release. 
	
	   I want to make sure this is captured so it can be used prior to the SIPR install. 


	   removed configfile xml pusher steps for mapper. 
	
	   We no longer need a separate tool for this in GCDS ESSl releases. MapBareBonesCreator 
	   created the file in the cdp filesets now and the appropirate ones will be pushed in 
	   the pre and post phases. 


	   added POD for all tests. 


	   checking in what I have so far. 
	
	   Failing on 3 tests against the dev network at this time. 
	
	   2 are false positives; I'll rewrite the tests to be more robust. 
	   still need to look at testSwitchConf2HasLeaders()
	   also need POD for tests. 


	   added ssh options, default to 2 second timeout. 


	   refactored the customer/edge app specific test cases into GcdsCustomerTestCases.pm


	   helps if I give the perl package the correct name. 


	   pulled out customer-specific tests. Documented test suite with POD.

	   vroom. vroom. 


	   fixing a bug where the netconfig files are not properly copied to edge servers. 
	   the conifigure_kdc.pl module expects that the netconfig files live in:
	   setup/netconfig-kdc
	
	   instead of
	
	   setup/netconfig-gcds-kdc


	   changing to new netconfig bundle for kdc-deployed. 


	   netconfig-gcds-kdc-deployed provides updated root.dsa keys that allow the keyagent 
	   process on the edge servers to authenticate kdc generated DSA keys.

	taking bind comps for DNS vuln.

	talking whitehat bind components bind9-9.3.5 and named-config-2.5.4.2


	taking os-install-ramdisk 5.0.5.1 to deal with our G1 Opterons

	accepting os-install-linux-2.4-5.3.9 to address STIG issues with os installs. 


	   added gcds-os-linux-2.4 to create a STIG-compliant OS install. 


	   installsuite 2.1.2 comps updated. added gcds-os-linux-2.4 so we can have a stig-compliant 
	   OS root.tgz available for OS installs. added mcdn-debpackageinfo to deal with us updating
	   the debian-gzip-3.0.1 comp. 


	bare bones documentation - first checkin


	   added some basic perldoc. 


	   renamed file to compare_ff_latest


	   deleting old/crufty ff2html and renaming ffcomp.pl 


	   initial branch into a better named component. 


	   no longer parsing output of diff. sanity has returned to my fevered brain.

	   removing unneeded netdeploy component. 


	   removed duplicate entry for python2-config

	   fixing bug for failed installs. configure_dpkg is looking for version '1.3.5-10sarge2aka01'


	   bumped mcdn-debpackageinfo to 1.1 
	   this component correctly lists the debian-gzip-3.0.1 in the manifest. 


	   forgot that this script programatically generates our componentinfo.xml file.
	   bumped the version number to 1.1 
	   it is currnetly failing bundle promotion in the build system. 
	   this should fix it. 


	   bumping version number to 1.1


	   removing the spurious (and non-valid xml) perforce ID tag on line 1. 


	   somehow a perforce $Id$ string wound up in the patch. removed.


	   first stab to update patch that includes debian gzip 3.0.1


	   first stab at a tool that compares two versions files. It will let
	   you know what components were added/removed/modified. 
	
	   currently it shells out to diff -y and parses that output. 
	   it appears that diff -y has a strange bug that sometimes causes it 
	   to report back incorrectly. Currently tracking that down. Will likely 
	   use standard diff and parse that output correctly on next pass. 


	   rolling back Rick's changes to remove update the openssh package.
	   I have reviewed with Rick the model of using a component like mcdn-debpackageinfo-1.0 
	   to make the same changes. 
	
	   The reason this is necessary is that it is breaking the patch applied to packageinfo.xml 
	   when the mcdn-debpackageinfo component is built. 


	   initial branch of 1.0 comp. Need to specify new gzip .deb. 


	Sigh. Injudicious use of html-tidy +  some validation to XHTML 1.0 Strict.

	   because itis too broad. 


	   CR 123377 -- bumping authgate-ui back to 3.2.1.9


	removed the 141.21 machine. We're using it for portal dev / CR verification. 


	   removing mcdn-stig-config-1.2 from release as we can't build that for SIPR just yet. 


	   Linking to CpMap table from the 'CPCode Bits Per Second' graph. Renaming HTML header in cpmap page. 


	   pointing cpcode query to essl aggs instead of mega aggs. This avoids the problem 
	   of measuring the traffic that the ghost process on the MDT servers is reporting
	   into ghostinfo. The ESSL aggs only have data from the edge servers, which is 
	   what we want to measure. 


	   adding functionality to display a page with cpcode tp cpname mapping. 


	   bug fix: updating schema insted of schema_verion. This causes netdeploy to fail 
	   when trying to apply version 2 of the database schema. 


	   ghost bumped to 5.2.4.9.2 -- this contains our rotated a248.e cert. 


	   initial branch for mcdn-2215


	   only one dash in label name. bug fixed. 


	   removing references to 'lgu' in various paths. This was for testing. Now production ready. 


	   removing netconfig bundle 'srr-unix'. this prevents SRRs from automatically running during hostsetup. 


	   new comp allows for SRR scripts to be automagically run after incremental install
	   usefule for regression testing in the lab. 


	   adding srr-unix to netconfig variable. Should fetch the SRR script and run it at netdeploy time
	   using this to verify CR 110147


	   adding mcdn-stig-cp to pick up mcdn_domain_name vars in config file
	   adding mcdn-stig-os to remove L026 SRR mitigation (immutable man bits)

	   adding mcdn-stig comps to address mutability issues with dpkg-api


	   new lds processing code that allows for stats gathering. 


	   The mapnocc components have been removed from this release. They belong in 
	   the opstools release instead (and they are already there; new and improved)


	   I *think* that I have figured out my problem. It is not related to the freeflow 
	   netconfig bundle, but to the kdc-qa netconfig bundle. reverting my change. 


	   bumping netconfig-kdc-qa up to 1.1 so that it matches our infra network. 
	   right now keyagent won't decrypt valid ESSL certs encrypted/signed by the 
	   KDC because is is using different certs. 


	   changing freeflow netconfig bundle to qa


	   lab testing showed that my kdc issues were not caused by the added *content* bundles. 
	   reverting back to previous version of the file. 


	   kdc is not working in testnet lab with netconfig-kdc-qa bundles due to 
	   missing aegis collections. I have the feeling that I made a horible 
	   decision years ago and I'm seeing if adding these comps back into the 
	   release fixes it. 


	   initial check in -- converts ff-latest.xml to HTML
	   only prints linux-2.4 comps and their version number. 


	   specifying local mdt certs for filesigning; needed for testnets. 


	   removing 141.40 -- this is slated for INFRA mega agg 


	   removing 141.11 -- this is an ESSL edge server. 


	   removing first line. Looks like cruft from around revision #14. 
	   configparse barks because it is not parseable. 


	   removed 141.11 and 141.12 boxen. These are ESSL edge servers. 


	   more IP conflict resolution. (can't we all just get along?)
	   141.17 is now a mega agg in infra
	   141.34 is now a CCI reflector in infra


	   resolving conflicts with IP addresses in configuration file. 172.24.141.22 was in

	   server.
	
	   Removed 172.24.141.34 from the .other box. It should be in .mapper2. 


	   added qa netconfig bundles and adjusted cdp_* to reflect those changes. 
	   also removed the query agg line since we're using spanning aggs in infra. 


	   removed linux-2.2 bundles. 


	   removing linux-2.2 bundles. party like it is 2007, baby!


	bumping versions for apache, apache-config, and bind9


	updating versions of apache, apache-config and bind9 


	integration of codeline for new relase MCDN-2043. 


	   changed govops.akamai.com to mcdn.akamai.com 


	   p4 integrated these files (change 1899600) so I could rename them. 


	   changed govops.akamai.com to mcdn.govops.akamai.com in arlindex.xml
	   integrate of remaining metadata files so I can rename. 


	initial checkin of metata to enable delivery of NIPRNET portal via edge.


	   changing control.akamai.csd.disa.mil from an A record to a CNAME.
	   removing control1.akamai.csd.disa.mil A record. 
	   additng origin1-control.akamai.csd.disa.mil A record
	   adding origin2-control.akamai.csd.disa.mil A record


	   adjusting awk example to use printf


	   initial checkin


	   enabling support to have portal delivered from the edge servers. 


	   added purgout table to schema. removed all rows except one on the (unused at this time) procedures table


	   adding the correct purge support to portal. Also extending functionality to include a purge history page. 


	   changed cron job for q2m.pl to be every 5 minutes
	   added cron jobs to produce .csv files for aca_alerts_view and cpmap tables
	   corrected file format for tableprov index.csv files


	   preservation of SSL certs and MSP certs should be working now. 


	   added support for raid5 installs


	   adding the ability for this label to support MCDNPORTAL and MAPNOCC 
	   netdeploys. 


	   fixed a typo in the regexp for procmail filtering of ghost.access.log files. 
	   (was missing a match at the end of the line...) 


	   cleaning up the cpcoder so that it works. 
	   1. added the correct path to msp.conf
	   2. added the ability for the ccuapi_publish file to read 
	      the CPCODER_EMAIL variable set by the configure_mcdportal module
	      (in the /a/etc/akamai.conf file)


	changing ownership of log dir to root


	   putting libgd into /usr/lib so php's gd.so can find it. 


	   getting the php libs down to what we think are the bare essentials. 


	   added tableprov calls to usereg()
	   removed 'images' alias in httpd.conf supplemental


	   adding the right directories for msp dsa key


	   Now I am actually trying to put the right akamake file in. 


	   putting the libpng libs and headers in a spot where the configure script for 
	   php will find them. 


	   typo: gd.so should be in /usr/local/lib/php4


	   the configure for php requires that I already have libpng and zlib built. 
	   changes made so that make is run for those libs prior to ./configure for php


	   removing the php libs/includes. These are handled by the php-1.3 comp.


	   added php.ini and also the gd.so lib so the damn thing will work. 


	   akamake will now configure/build libpng and zlib prior to php
	   componentinfo will now add the resuling libpng and zlib libs. 
	   added tarball for both libpng and zlib


	   bumping comp version to 1.3 


	   branching from 1.2. Adding gd support to php


	   these are sundry scripts used by the mcdnportal for logdelivery, purge, etc. 	


	   finally adding tzdata changes back into patch


	   added bwt appendix. Adjusted testplan for its use. 


	initial check in. 


	   added cron jobs for mcnportal as well as the 'cpcoder' scripts. 


	initial check in of 'cpcoder' code that runs as a cron job on the portal. 
	   This program will extract users from the database that are allowed to purge
	   and then create two .dat files while the CCUAPI can use to authenticate 
	   purge requests that are coming to it via SOAP. 


	   Initial check in of the MCDN Portal code so that it can be netdeployable. 
	   At this time, the code supports:
	    - install OS w/ RAID5 via the variances stanza in configuration file
	    - identify the portal with the host tag of 'MCDNPORTAL=$INT' where $INT is > 1
	       - this allows mysql to be setup as master or slave so the database can be 
	         replicated. This is stubbed out for future growth. 
	    - configuring apache w/ PHP and mod_ssl support.
	    - config files live in /a/etc/mcdnportal (a self-signed SSL cert as well)
	    - PHP lives in /ghostcache/mcdnportal/htdocs
	    - MySQL database lives in /ghostcache/mcdnportal/mysql
	    - The directory /ghostcache/mcdnportal/mysql is preserved across OS installs. 


	   added the 172.22.79.22 host as a dev MAPNOCC box. Going to try and install it out of the mapper2 config


	   added our B2B gateway box. It is now named 'wilson' after the most hated 
	   Wilson Bridge down in the D.C. area. 


	   initial checkin of our OKC front end switch configs. These switches are 
	   located in racks 1, 2, and 3. 


	   fixed a bug where the sql values for the 'SQL' field in the alerts
	   file would be created with invalid sql. 
	
	   This happened if the sql statement was formatted such that the FROM 
	   or WHERE statements started on a new line. Here's an example:
	
	   SQL: select foo
	   from bar
	   where qux="baz";
	
	   Prior to fix the script would mangle this to:
	
	   SQL: select foofrom 
	   bar
	   where qux="baz";
	
	   This invalid sql can not be executed by the aggs, thus reducing our 
	   NOCC visibility. 
	
	   All better now. 


	   OKC CCC staff would like a script that they can reload MapNOCC pages with. 
	   This helps them prevent burn-in on their monitors. 


	   initial check in. List of alert IDs that need some love. 


	   bringing over the modified queries that we have in the field.
	   We can now use this file as input to produce the correct All.txt 
	   that is used on the NIPR ams server. 


	   duh. only needed one carriage return for last record. fixed. 


	   small bug fix. adjust link to domain for procedures so that we don't get
	   duplicate 'www.nocc' prefixes. 
	
	   also added two carriage returns at end of file to signify end of last record. 


	   added capability to tunnel through to NIPR Portal as well. 


	   initial checkin. 
	   script will set up myriad ssh tunnels so I can connect up to the 
	   mapnocc and ams alerts viewer web apps on the NIPRNET. 


	   removing NTP Stratum alert and adding a simple check for down machines in INFRA. 


	   updated A record for wiki


	   adding new SRR scripts from Nov 2006. Also adding text file which 
	   translates the old SDID numbers to the new SDID numbers


	   initial checkin. The srr_watch program is intended to be run from cron 
	   (currently, I do this on the wiki.govops.akamai.com server). 
	
	   It will check the DISA website to see if the SRR scripts have been updated. 
	   If so, it will email me. 


	   initial checkin of helpful troubleshooting apps for our test site. 


	   minor typo fixes. 


	   fixed the component name. Now it will build. 


	   initial check in of my lunch and learn notes.


	   adding a nice, spiffy index.html page for our group so it can get picked up by docs.akamai.com.


	   adding lab SSL certs for testing on sipr. 


	   comment for me to check that openssl is actually installed. Will do this later...


	   refactored. I've tested this over the past four nights and it looks solid. 


	   new and improved wiki backup script. will let this run for a bit. 


	   integrating my batch of mapper2 (1691)
	                           infra (1692)
	                           essl (1693) 
	
	   releases from NIPRNET => SIPRNET.


	   added fflow-ccu hostname so that puserntfy can connect to that host


	   replacing 49.12 with 49.17 -- old one had a bad disk. 


	   repointing origin-test to our new machine. 


	   noted that both these files are deprecated and have moved to the wiki. 


	   changed ktext+x and added some documentation to comments to
	   help others who see them for the first time. 


	   chaning over to the *nipr.govops.akamai.com domain. 


	   these are old and crufty now. (just like kkc!)
	   these are deprecated in favor of the shiny, new *nipr.govops.akamai.com.xml


	   pointing the old govops.akamai.com hostname to nipr.govops.akamai.com


	   changing domains over to NIPR subdomain of .govops.akamai.com


	   added mapnocc comps. We're going to deloy MapNOCC out of this label. 


	   removed the email_relay option until we get control of how much email that our network 
	   is sending through the corporate relays. Also what kind of mail that we are sending. 
	   We just found a bug where our kdc had sent mail to the production kmi-admin list. 
	   We are pretty sure that is because we now have the ability to specify a per-region SMTP
	   relay for our siprnet installs. We configured an internal server as a relay and this 
	   allowed our otherwise filtered mail to get through.
	
	   investigating. 


	   added 214.4.230.92 as MDT server to bring quorum up to a sane number (5). 
	   also removed useless alexandria stanza. 


	   initial checkin. 


	   The kmi collection for mcm was sending mail to the prod kmi-admin lists. 
	   Changing email address to reflect correct niprnet address. 


	   Removing akaroute comps because the -config was publishing (via CDP) a kmi collection 
	   that was sending mail to the default kmi-admin lists for the kmi-akaroute-ssh-id SSH
	   key pair. 
	
	   There are two ways of addressing this. We could branch the -config comp and change the 
	   email address destination to something on the NIPR/SIPR. Or we could remove the 
	   component from our release. In talking with the comp owner (cborste), he advises that 
	   this comp is *old* and deprecated. The easiest way to address is to remove it from 
	   our release. 


	   changing purge_keys_source to deployed so that purgeapi SSL certs get 
	   preserved across OS and incremental installs. 


	   changes made so that we use the 'deployed' ca-bundle.crt and we preserve it across
	   os and incremental netdeploys. 


	   fixing bug with tmp dir cleanup as well as throwing an error if the 
	   comp that you want to build can not be found in ff-latest.xml


	   added irc hostname A record. 


	   Fixing problem where the DoD signed certs work in the lab, but fail in production. The USAF 
	   SSL libraries used by the SOAP client require the chaining cert. 


	   removing the push for the akamai.govops.akamai.com domain since we do not use it anymore. 


	   kickstart A record added. 


	   Added the network variables 'mcdn_deployment', 'mcdn_netreconfig', and 'mcdn_default_ntp' 
	   to support the changes made in the mcdn-stig-*-1.1 comps. 


	   adding these two helper script so we can sync and build mcdn releases. 


	   updated A record for mdt-serv.


	   adding CNAME record for oldwiki.govops.akamai.com


	   changing ip for new address of wiki. 


	   initial checkin.


	   setting new ip values for acl rules on siprnet lab. 


	   Stupid checkin. There is no need for a .bak file...


	   This script is superceded by the same script in the eng/bin directory. 
	   Ops should never need to run this tool. Best located in eng dir. 


	   This script has a name clash with the 'go' script in eng/bin. 
	   Removing it because of this and the questionable utility of the damn thing anyway. 


	   setting the +x flag so this is executable. 


	   Adding a reminder that I need to concatenate the files that I submit in the change_spec. 


	   re-write of the go script to pull configs from rc file. 


	   Now that we have migrated the mapper2 network to SecureOS, we do not need 
	   to use this bundler version. 


	   We do not need this scripts anymore. We have hostsetup logic to put the right 
	   ntp configs on the servers no matter what network we have them deployed into. 


	   These little backup scripts are not needed now that Zlatan has hooked us up with 
	   a proper tape-based backup solution.


	   moving to lunderhi sandbox. 


	   script not ready for group use. Putting it into my sandbox to die or to 
	   get refactored so that it is useable for a larger audience. 


	   This script is superceded by the ops/bin/port-ping script. 
	   Please use that instead. 


	   This script is superceded by ops/bin/essl_network_check
	   Please use that instead. 


	   This script has been improved, with added functionality. It is now located in 
	   //projects/gcdn/common/eng/bin/ports_n_protocols/...


	   This script is superceded by the one in ops/bin dir. 
	   Please use that one. 


	   This scripts are superceded by the mdt_push script in the ops/bin dir.
	   Please use that one instead. 


	   This script is superceded by the ops/bin/cdp-wrapper script. 
	   Please use that one instead. 


	   This script is superceded by the cwd2rcs script in the ops/bin dir. 
	   Please use that script instead. 


	   This script is superceded by the cdp-wrapper script in the ops/bin dir.
	   Please use that one instead. 


	   This script is not relevant since we have extended the 'go' script to use 
	   an .rc file to pick up release-specific variables. Please use the 'go' script 
	   instead of this one. 


	   The functionality of this script is already performed by the kmi_util program. 


	   This is moved to my sandbox because it is not suitable for group use. 


	   extended the cdp-wrapper script to use an .rc file. 
	   This helps us use it equally well in lab/production without changing 
	   variables in the script. 


	   This is a one-off script that is not robust enough for group use. 
	   Moving to my sandbox


	   adding sipr-lab as mcdn_network name so we can pick up the correct changes that 
	   condfigure_mcdnstig.pl makes to the root hints files. 


	   moving away from $NETWORKNAME-go script to a generalized 'go' script that reads
	   variables from an .rc file. 
	
	   First pass. Ready for limited use by others. 


	   changing the behavior of the script so that it generates the root hints file depending 
	   upon the network that you are in. 


	   updating network type to be sipr-lab. 
	   This allows the mcdn-stig-config component to set the root hints file to 
	   something we can use (instead of the nipr/sipr specific ones)


	   bumping ghost version to 5.2.4.9.1 and apache version to 3.8.6.1.1 so we can 
	   take openssl changes for whitehat release. 


	   bumping apache version to 3.8.6.1.1 so we can take openssl whitehat changes to apache. 


	   bumping version from 3.8.6.1 to 3.8.6.1.1. This is done to support
	   building against openssl 3.2.2 which is required for our current whitehat 
	   release. 


	   bumping version number from 5.2.4.9 => 5.2.4.9.1 to accomodate openssl whitehat release. 
	   We need to build against openssl 3.2.2 to address new crop 'o vulnerabilities. 


	   bumping version number of ghost so that it builds correctly. 
	   5.2.4.9 => 5.2.4.9.1
	
	   This is to accomodate the whitehate openssl release. 


	   bumping version to .1 to accomodate our openssl vuln release. 


	   typo in the akamai version of the .deb. 


	   Replacing debian-openssh and debpackageinfo with mcdn-debian-openssh and 
	   mcdn-debpackageinfo for our sirp/nipr releases. 


	   pactching the packageinfo.xml file to include the full set of changes required for our openssh package. 


	   first attempt at a fix for missing mcdnstig tableprov dir. 


	   removed the static index.csv file from componentinfo.xml. We'll generate it at hostsetup time. 


	   creating the index.csv for mcdnstig tableprov in the hostsetup module now. 


	   trying to fix a problem where my (properly building) component is failing bundle. 


	   fixing akamake so that it applies our patches and generates our componentinfo.xml file
	   BEFORE it runs the akamake in the dependent debpackageinfo component. 


	
	  adding mcdn-stig components so that a machine will be configured to
	  DISA STIG specs once it has been incrementaled.
	
	  These components also support the ability to specifiy a network-specific
	  DNS root "hints" file, a per-region NTP clock source, and a per-region
	  SMTP relay (these chages are required for deployment on the SIPRNET.

	   branching our new siprnet infra versions file from our current infra
	   release (MCDN-1321)


	   branching this new siprnet mapper2 versions file from our current 
	   mcdn mapping release (MCDN-1379)


	   removing this debian-openssh dir. Files were branced to mcdn-debian-openssh


	   branching from the directory with a wrong name (debian-openssh instead of mcdn-debian-openssh)


	initial checkin of components that will produce a mcdn-specific debpackageinfo


	   adding some comments and removing old crufty comments about 'hack yes button'


	   changing msp server to 79.35 (sync with our MDT server now being 79.35)


	   moving the .16 machine from MDT (bad hard disk) to the .35 machine. 


	   the .21 machine is down at the moment. Moving the MDT server to the .16 machine. 


	   fixing bundler path to point to new location in our depot. 


	   changing to point to Stager in the SIPR lab. 


	   changing label name for better readability

	   Finally, noted the (few) remaining machines that are free for other use. 


	changed IP addrs of authgateUI from 49.10 -> 49.19
	   removed useless/commented-out NOCCGWs that we don't use
	   added kkc's mapper2 agg as spanning agg. 


	   removing the agg from mapper config file and making it a spanning agg in INFRA. 


	pulled 49.18 from region 1 because it is not actually plugged into the Foundry.
	   changed hostoptions for the .30 machine to be CLNS and to backstop region 2. 
	   removed buildlayer machine (that was actually commented out) from region 3


	   changing to allow the component to run on the SIRP or the NIPR net.

	   small bug fixes. 


	   initial checkin. This file will be wget'd off the kickstart server
	   and then decrypted, and run on a sipr laptop so it can get ssh keys
	   and the bootstrap_pull script. 


	   improving sipr_laptop bootstrap system:
	       post: adding perm fixing to /install
	       pull: pulling in sipr_laptop dir in my sandbox
	       push: typos


	   loop to adjust permissions on a label so it can be packed by non-root users. 


	   initial checkin


	   initial checkin.


	   extending script to only run syncit if specified with arg.
	   adding some dirs in //projects/gcdn/... to check. 


	   initial checkin of liveheaders that works with firefox 1.5


	   added support for modifying /etc/ntp.conf.


	   fixed bug with pack args. Pointing to ff-latest.xml now. 


	   Good place to break. These four scripts work together to get a working NOCCGW 
	   deployed onto the SIRPNET. We have basic functionality now. Picking up more dev 
	   in the morning. 


	   fixed bug with ipchains and mcdn-stig-cp not bundling correctly. 


	   initial (and rough) check in of files that we are going to use to configure a noccgw in SIRPNET. 


	   using this pack for our releases on SIPR.


	   fixing ipchains problem. Should be bundling now. 


	   taking the time to check in the tools that I have been using on the NIPRNET...


	   moving tools around in our depot. As of right now, these are the libs that we are using
	   on our production noccgw. 


	   Moving content around in the repository. As of today, this represents the tools
	   on our deployed noccgw machines that we are using. 


	   initial checkin of script to sync content from a sipr_laptop to the boostrap noccgw.


	   initial checkin of prep script so that our dev box is up to date prior to us pulling 
	   content down onto our sipr laptops. 


	   We want to have syncit generate a new .db with every run. 


	   annoted README files to note that cpcoder is not automatically installed. 


	   We are going to integrate the cpcoder component with our portal install. Initial branch. 


	   added support for bundling ipchains-config-1.8.9.1


	   bumping ipchains-config to 1.8.9.1


	   needed to change our BUILDLAYER machine to noccgw.


	   bumping version number to 1.8.9.1


	   branching ipchains for SIPR network. The configure script contains a hardcoded IP address to 
	   allow mail through from the portal. 


	   This script is responsible for pulling over the necessary data from our working install gateway
	   and onto the SIPR laptops that we are going to install. 


	   initial checkin of our bootstrap configuration file that we intend to

	   first stab.
	      qa_mitigations.sh will scp the DISA STIG tarball up to a remote host
	      and execute the SRR scripts. It will then suck the results back and make 
	      sure that the SRR scripts are not finding anything open that we have explicitly 
	      mitigated. 
	
	      unix-44-15-mar06.tar.gz is the DISA STIG tarball
	
	      gen_srr_audit_script.sh will generate the file 'srr_audit_script.pl' which is 
	      suitable for netdeploying to a host. It will call the check() function on all the STIG
	      module that we have written. If any return with problems, the script dies and 
	      netdeploy will bark. This script take no operation on the system. It just collects data. 


	   These are the 17 OS level mitigations that we have entered against our image so far. 
	   an initial test via netdeploy looks good.

	   removing Zlatan's test machine that we were using for training. 


	   now pulling MDT updates through edge servers. 


	   starting to pull MDT updates over the edge using a1.mdt.govops.akamai.com hostname
	
	   This hostname is a placeholder until mapping is up in the lab. 


	   changing my MDT hostname to a1.mdt.govops.akamai.com


	   Adding a pointer to the wiki. We don't really use this directory anymore. 
	
	   Will clean up in a bit. 


	   didn't like the origin hostname for netdeploy. too confusing with MDT stagers. 


	   fixed bug where using disa_access_ip. Should be using the correct array @disa_access_list


	   netdeploy is hardcoded to use a4.$DOMAIN, so fixing here. Also added stager ip. 


	   adding a couple of test hostnames for mdt-edge and netdeploy.


	   splitting region_block on ';' to help generate the access-list used by Foundry
	   for the telnet ACL


	   added origin-test at 172.22.49.24


	   new format for essl index. experimenting and trying to get right. 


	   the previous key that I had was incorrect. Re-encrypted with the correct symmetric key. 


	   ghost is failing to start up. Following directions in openssl.c and updating these files as well to fix.


	   This change will use the exact IPs of the ESSL edge servers for region_block.
	   region_block is used by Foundry.pm to configure the telnet ACL on the switch. 
	   The default is the /24 that the host is in. We have a lot of other types of 
	   machines in the /24 besides ESSL, hence the stricter ACL.

	   worked my way through the hostsetup examples located at:
	   https://dev.akamai.com/p4/projects/shared/hostsetup_cleanup/akamai/hostsetup/doc/configure_module.txt
	
	   all subs have been defined in the configure_rtsplite.pl script now, so 
	   I am getting close to testing...


	   changed ownership of files from root to akamai since I am installing into
	   /usr/local/akamai


	   adding supporting files to make the rtsplite-config bundle.


	   adding my first attempt at writing a configure_foo.pl module from scratch.
	   Using the RTSP::Lite perl module as a test since it is"
	       (a) a useful module for testing streams in a remote lab 
	       (b) it really is just one .pm file, so the install should be simple.
	
	   This configure_script shoull only install the rtsp bundle on a machine
	   installed as a NOCCGW.


	   intial check-in of RTSP::Lite component. This is largely a test for
	   me as I learn how to build components (and this is a useful library 
	   for me to have netdeployable to a machine since I can use it for 
	   testing QT/REAL/WMS streams with a perl client.)


	   initial checkin of infra configfile for disa project.


	Added a sample region config to the file.


	initial checkin of essl config file to use for testing DISA GCDN 


	   didn't mean to add this file to the repository.


	initial add of govops internal website. This is currently a static 
	   snapshot of the website. Need to get automated backups going...


	   the 'go' and 'syncit' scripts are useful when for building, bundling,
	   packing, and netdeploying releases quickly.


	   new README file explaining this directory.


	   This file does not belong here. It is in //projects/gcdn/dcts/ffs/...


	   this file does not belong here. It is in //projects/gcdn/dcts/...


	   more cleanup work from my p4 integrate


	   trying to clean up this bork'd p4 integrate I did.


	   adding ffs directory from DCTS project into new gcdn perforce directory.


	   added pptp documentation from DCTS project into new gcdn depot.


	   adding edgesuite directory for the DCTS project into new gcdn depot.


	adding documentation for DCTS into new gcdn depot.


	   We now have our own depot in //projects/gcdn. Yay us!
	
	   Doing a p4 integrate from dsw's sandbox for all of our work done on 
	   the DCTS projects. It will now live in //projects/gcdn/dcts/...


	   adding common config dirs for dns & ntpd setup in DCTS lab.


	adding configuration files for dcts project into new gcdn depot.


	   added 172.22.49.11 as a NOCC gateway -- we're also going to use this for DNS on dcts.akamai.com


	   made changes to enable the ability to have a SR1 that does CCI and 
	   streaming portsets for GCDN DCTS project.


	   adding the gcnd_translate module for configparse.


	   integrating the reflector-2.12 component into the gcdn depot so I can make
	   my changes into.

	   enabled cache:must-revalidate


	   first round of test results...


	   added no-store for /cgi-bin directory.


	   no-stored the /cgi-bin directory.


	   changed legend on graph so that origin and edge strings dynamic based on 
	   values of $opt_origin_url and $opt_edge_url. -- also fixed bug so that the
	   script will work on machines without GD::Graph...


	   added flag to make graphing the results optional so I can run this from 
	   a host without the ImageMagick libraries installed (or even an X server
	   installed on it...)


	   added support for requesting the object with compression enabled.

	   newly updated file ... getting rid of QA cruft...


	   trying to delete...


	   no changes...


	   fixed typo in 50.50.50.* ip addr


	   I screwed up and did not have 'qtrelease' in many of the map variables.


	   resolving #5 #6 edits...


	   changed set reflectors to all be leaders in different regions


	   working with kkc on partitioning the lab regions properly. First pass.


	One more time, but with $Id:$


	   Trying to format $Id$ tags properly so revision number gets picked up 
	   from perforce...


	   First check-in. This is my first stab at creating a FFS config file for
	   our little lab down in SAIC. 


	   changed reflector port ranges: more testing by larry


	   initial check-in.

	   changed reflector ports used by the EPs.


	   initial checkin.


	   script is stable and can submit zone files up to our DNS server in the lab now.


	   initial checkin. Modification of gen_ref_dns.pl, but without capability to
	   submit the file to a bind server and HUP it.


	   added ccare user


	   changed reflector and submanager domains to newly created ref.dsts.akamai.com domain.


	   properly generating zone files now and it scp's it up to the server
	   and HUPs the bind process to reload the file if --submit is passed.


	   initial check-in.


	   initial check in. simple wrapper to allow for msubmits on our MDT server.


	   Initial check-in.

	   file to our MDT server and then run msubmit.


	   Had to remove a bad hero address on the EP -- I am dubm.


	   Changed over to using QA version of FFS config file as template. Modifying this to fit our needs now.


	   initial check in. Based off of ref2.akamai.com...


	   working on setting up query agg --- modified query agg to match production FFS config file.


	   initial checkin.


	   initial check in.


	   initial check in.


	Initial check-in. Original code by David Makofske. I modified it to remove 
	   references to the old adult content maps and WMS Corona maps. Now using
	   v1 ARLs for the DCTS project. The domain variable is hardcoded to use the
	   'akareal' domain name. If WMS or QT enters the scope of the contract, we 
	   will need to change this.


	   Initial check-in. Original code by David Makofske. I modified it so that
	   it only calls Real live/ondemand methods for the v3 DCTS project.


	   initial check-in.


	   Initial checkin-in. This class originally provided by David Makofske. 
	   Slight modifications done on this to take out references/subroutines 
	   that dealt with the adult content maps and the WMS Corona beta maps.
	
	   Changed the class to NOT use v2 ARLs since we are going to use v1 ARLs
	   for the DCTS project -- the domain variable is hardcoded to use the 
	   'akareal' domain. Will need to change that to accomodate WMS or QT should
	   that enter the scope of the contract.


	   changed reflector_domain to match with ff and ffs config files


	   commented out 172.22.49.24 as a cci-reflector. It is installed as a set-reflector in the ffs config file.


	   changed reflector_domain to match the configuration.dcts.ffs config file


	   needed to change DTD so I was using the right one.


	   adding new skeleton reflector XML file for EP 172.22.49.23


	   deleting reflector.xml


	   initial check-in. Skeleton file for real user/pass on EP.


	   Added new unique id (4) for the EP 172.22.49.23. I see that this unique ID is listed in the configuration.dcts.ffs file for the EP, so I wanted to bring it inline with the reflector.xml file I am generating.


	When a stream gets sent into an EP, the RealServe will make the stream 
	   available on a specific mountpoint. This script will (a) test the stream
	   automatically on this mountpoint for you, (b) Give you the full URL to 
	   the stream on that mountpoint and (c) tell you what protocol (important 
	   for troubleshooting sometimes) the encoder is using to connect to the EP.


	Initial checkin. Libraries for generating streaming auth tokens.


	Initial checkin. FFS.pm is a collection of subs that I wrote to make my 
	   life easier in troubleshooting various streams. Requires MakeToken.pm and 
	   RTSP::Lite, both of which are in ccare's @INC.


	   Initial checkin. Troubleshooting tool to help find right URL to pull real stream 
	   off of an EP.


	Initial checkin. Troubleshooting tool to automate the fetching of
	   dyamically generated Admin passwords for Real HTML console.

	   Took out the dummy EP address so I can generate a valid reflector.xml.


	   Initial checkin. Quick script to generate /a/etc/reflector.xml for the
	   EntryPoints in the dcts project.


	   took the .17 machine in region 3 and removed akanote as a service.


	   having trouble installing linux-2.4 on incremental install. Failing because of missing value for netconfig line. Added kdc-deployed.
	
	   Also we had dup lines for Query HMAC keys. Removed the dupe lines...


	   troubleshooting problem with installing 172.22.49.16 -- removed akanote


	   Changed hmac keys to match the configuraton.dcts file


	   Initial checkin...

	   Starting to work on adding the Ssh module


	I actually screwed up. There were no changes made


	script that takes an authentication token and gives you clue


	   This module is required to run the ~ccare/bin/auth_parse.pl script


	I added support for authenticated streams


	This tool allows ccare folks to troubleshoot live streams on FFS


	
	   Removed cc-inside in the 'CC:' on the email alert subroutine


	changed target email address to my pager instead of akamai email account

	fixed syntax error


	   fixed my email_alert() subroutine


	new ingress script


	new and improved ingress script


	edited ingress script to use entrypointstats rather than reflectorstats
